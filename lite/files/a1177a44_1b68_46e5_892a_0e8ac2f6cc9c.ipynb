If the occurrence of some\nillness is under study, those who have the illness are often\nclassified as \"cases\", and those without it are \"noncases\".  The\ncounts of the occurrences of these classes gives a contingency\ntable\n```\n\nexposed    unexposed\ncases          a           b\nnoncases       c           d\n\n```\nThe sample odds ratio may be written ``(a/c) / (b/d)``.  ``a/c`` can\nbe interpreted as the odds of a case occurring in the exposed group,\nand ``b/d`` as the odds of a case occurring in the unexposed group.\nThe sample odds ratio is the ratio of these odds.  If the odds ratio\nis greater than 1, it suggests that there is a positive association\nbetween being exposed and being a case.\n\nInterchanging the rows or columns of the contingency table inverts\nthe odds ratio, so it is important to understand the meaning of labels\ngiven to the rows and columns of the table when interpreting the\nodds ratio.\n\nConsider a hypothetical example where it is hypothesized that exposure to a\ncertain chemical is associated with increased occurrence of a certain\ndisease. Suppose we have the following table for a collection of 410 people\n```\n\nexposed unexposed\ncases        7       15\nnoncases    58      472\n\n```\nThe question we ask is \"Is exposure to the chemical associated with\nincreased risk of the disease?\"\n\nCompute the odds ratio:\n",
