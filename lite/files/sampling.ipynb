    "\n",
    "SciPy provides an interface to many universal non-uniform random number\n",
    "generators to sample random variates from a wide variety of univariate\n",
    "continuous and discrete distributions. Implementations of a fast C library\n",
    "called [UNU.RAN](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/software/unuran/) are used\n",
    "for speed and performance. Please look at [UNU.RAN's\n",
    "documentation](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/software/unuran/doc/unuran.html)\n",
    "for an in-depth explanation of these methods. It is heavily referred to\n",
    "for writing this tutorial and the documentation of all the generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variate generation is the small field of research that deals with\n",
    "algorithms to generate random variates from various distributions. It is\n",
    "common to assume that a uniform random number generator is available.\n",
    "This is a program that produces a sequence of independent and identically\n",
    "distributed continuous U(0,1) random variates (i.e. uniform random variates\n",
    "on the interval (0,1)). Of course, real-world computers can never generate\n",
    "ideal random numbers and they cannot produce numbers of arbitrary precision\n",
    "but state-of-the-art uniform random number generators come close to this\n",
    "aim. Thus random variate generation deals with the problem of transforming\n",
    "such a sequence of U(0,1) random numbers into non-uniform random variates.\n",
    "These methods are universal and work in a black-box fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some methods to do that are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Inversion method: When the inverse $F^{-1}$ of the cumulative\n",
    "  distribution function is known, then random variate generation is easy.\n",
    "  We just generate a uniformly U(0,1) distributed random number U and\n",
    "  return $X = F^{-1}(U)$. As closed form solutions for the inverse\n",
    "  are rarely available, one usually needs to rely on approximations of\n",
    "  the inverse (e.g. {class}`scipy.special.ndtri`,\n",
    "  {class}`scipy.special.stdtrit`). In general, the implementation of special\n",
    "  functions is quite slow compared to the inversion methods in UNU.RAN.\n",
    "* The Rejection Method: The rejection method, often called\n",
    "  acceptance-rejection method, has been suggested by John von Neumann in\n",
    "  1951[^1]. It involves computing an upper bound to the PDF (also called the\n",
    "  hat function) and using the inversion method to generate a random\n",
    "  variate, say Y, from this bound. Then a uniform random number can be\n",
    "  drawn between 0 to the value of the upper bound at Y. If this number\n",
    "  is less than the PDF at Y, return the sample otherwise reject it. See\n",
    "  {class}`scipy.stats.sampling.TransformedDensityRejection`.\n",
    "* The Ratio-of-Uniforms Method: This is a type of acceptance-rejection\n",
    "  method which is uses minimal bounding rectangles to construct the hat\n",
    "  function. See {class}`scipy.stats.sampling.RatioUniforms`.\n",
    "* Inversion for Discrete Distributions: The difference compared to the\n",
    "  continuous case is that $F$ is now a step-function. To realize\n",
    "  this in a computer, a search algorithm is used, the simplest of which\n",
    "  is *sequential search*. A uniform random number is generated from\n",
    "  U(0, 1) and probabilities are summed until the cumulative probability\n",
    "  exceeds the uniform random number. The index at which this happens is\n",
    "  the required random variate and is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on these algorithms can be found in the [appendix of the UNU.RAN\n",
    "user manual](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/software/unuran/doc/unuran.html#RVG).\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating random variates of a distribution, two factors are important\n",
    "to determine the speed of a generator: the setup step and the actual sampling.\n",
    "Depending on the situation, different generators can be optimal. For example,\n",
    "if one repeatedly needs to draw large samples from a given distribution with\n",
    "a fixed shape parameter, a slow setup is acceptable if the sampling is fast.\n",
    "This is called the fixed parameter case. If one aims to generate samples of\n",
    "a distribution for different shape parameters (the varying parameter case),\n",
    "an expensive setup that needs to be repeated for each parameter would lead\n",
    "to very poor performance. In such a situation, a fast setup is crucial to\n",
    "achieve good performance. An overview of the setup and sampling speed of the\n",

    "\n",
    "Every generator needs to be set up before one can start sampling from it.\n",
    "This can be done by instantiating an object of that class. Most of the\n",
    "generators take a distribution object as input which contains the implementation\n",
    "of required methods like PDF, CDF, etc. In addition to the distribution\n",
    "object, one can also pass parameters used to set up the generator. It is also\n",
    "possible to truncate the distributions using a `domain` parameter.  All\n",
    "generators need a stream of uniform random numbers that are transformed into\n",
    "random variates of the given distribution. This is done by passing a `random_state`\n",
    "parameter with a NumPy BitGenerator as the uniform random number generator.\n",
    "`random_state` can either be a integer, {class}`numpy.random.Generator`,\n",
    "or {class}`numpy.random.RandomState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "   Use of NumPy < 1.19.0 is discouraged as it doesn't have a fast\n",
    "   Cython API for generating uniform random numbers and might be\n",
    "   too slow for practical use.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All the generators have a common `rvs` method that can be used to draw\n",
    "samples from the given distribution.\n",
    "\n",
