For the large `hop`\ninterval of 4.9 s, the window has small values around t = 0, which are\nnot covered by the overlap of the adjacent windows, which could lead to\nnumeric inaccuracies. Furthermore, the peaky shape at the beginning and\nthe end of the window points to a higher bandwidth, resulting in a\npoorer time-frequency resolution of the STFT.\nHence, the choice of the `hop` interval will be a compromise between\na time-frequency resolution and memory requirements demanded by small\n`hop` sizes.\n",
