In a randomized clinical trial of 30 subjects, 15 were\n    inoculated with a recombinant DNA influenza vaccine and the 15 were\n    inoculated with a placebo. Twelve of the 15 subjects in the placebo\n    group (80%) eventually became infected with influenza whereas for the\n    vaccine group, only 7 of the 15 subjects (47%) became infected. The\n    data are tabulated as a 2 x 2 table\n```\n\nVaccine  Placebo\nYes     7        12\nNo      8        3\n\n```\nWhen working with statistical hypothesis testing, we usually use a\nthreshold probability or significance level upon which we decide\nto reject the null hypothesis $H_0$. Suppose we choose the common\nsignificance level of 5%.\n\nOur alternative hypothesis is that the vaccine will lower the chance of\nbecoming infected with the virus; that is, the probability $p_1$ of\ncatching the virus with the vaccine will be *less than* the probability\n$p_2$ of catching the virus without the vaccine.  Therefore, we call\n`barnard_exact` with the ``alternative=\"less\"`` option:\n",
