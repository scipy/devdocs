In this case, Lilliefors [6] argued that\nthe KS test is far too conservative (that is, the p-value overstates\nthe actual probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis) and thus lacks\npower - the ability to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis\nis actually false.\nIndeed, our p-value above is approximately 0.28, which is far too large\nto reject the null hypothesis at any common significance level.\n\nConsider why this might be. Note that in the KS test above, the statistic\nalways compares data against the CDF of a normal distribution fitted to the\n*observed data*. This tends to reduce the value of the statistic for the\nobserved data, but it is \"unfair\" when computing the statistic for other\nsamples, such as those we randomly draw to form the Monte Carlo null\ndistribution. It is easy to correct for this: whenever we compute the KS\nstatistic of a sample, we use the CDF of a normal distribution fitted\nto *that sample*.
