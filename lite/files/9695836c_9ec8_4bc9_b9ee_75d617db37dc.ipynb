Of the 63 scientists, 31 said they were very satisfied with\ntheir jobs, whereas 74 of the college professors were very satisfied\nwith their work. Is this significant evidence that college\nprofessors are happier with their work than scientists?\nThe following table summarizes the data mentioned above\n```\n\ncollege professors   scientists\nVery Satisfied   74                     31\nDissatisfied     43                     32\n\n```\nWhen working with statistical hypothesis testing, we usually use a\nthreshold probability or significance level upon which we decide\nto reject the null hypothesis $H_0$. Suppose we choose the common\nsignificance level of 5%.\n\nOur alternative hypothesis is that college professors are truly more\nsatisfied with their work than scientists. Therefore, we expect\n$p_1$ the proportion of very satisfied college professors to be\ngreater than $p_2$, the proportion of very satisfied scientists.\nWe thus call `boschloo_exact` with the ``alternative=\"greater\"`` option:\n",
